# Cracklebot

Finding music can be a time consuming process. Cracklebox puts all effort into finding music so you don't have to.
It aggregates simple links on some specific subreddits and posts them to the  [@cracklebox](https://twitter.com/cracklebox) Twitter account.

##Requirements

The music bot requires Python 3.3+ and the following imports. I recommend making a venv with pip3 for installs.


* tweepy
* time
* sys 
* re
* os
* pickle
* praw
